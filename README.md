## Objective:  
To create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.  

## Data Description:  
The data is splitted into two parts:  
* Training set  
* Test set  
  
Here, the training set is used to build machine learning models and the test set is used for the evaluatation on the trained model.   

## Data attributes:  

**Survived:**	Survival	(0 = No, 1 = Yes)     
**Pclass:**	Ticket class	(1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)   
**Sex:**	Sex	  
**Age:** Age in years              
**Sibsp:**	Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	     
**Parch:**	Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic
